Thank you for sending an expression of interest to enrol on the next intake
in the Peoples-uni. The next intake will be in September 2010,
and we will contact you beforehand when we are open for enrolments.
In the meantime, you may want to look through the course module Foundations
of Public Health at http://courses.peoples-uni.org/course/view.php?id=53
which is freely available as an demonstration course module to show you
what a module looks like and to set the scene for you.
You may also want to look in detail through the particular parts of the
web site http://peoples-uni.org under the section 'Potential Students'.
You can also ask any question in the section marked 'Ask a Question'
under the 'Community' heading, and view the Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQ) on the top right hand corner of the site.

We look forward to seeing you on the course soon.

Dear GIVEN_NAME_HERE,

This is to provide feedback to you about your contributions to the
discussion forums in each of the Topics in the module.
As you will know from the section in the Student Handbook
http://peoples-uni.org/content/discussion-contributions
contributions to the discussion forums should “show reflection
and critical thought, and understanding of relevant literature.
You should include reference to your own experience,
to the resources in the module, and give a reference to a
published paper or web site”. This is not only to help with your
learning, but also “help prepare for the assignment –
the unit assignment requires you to answer questions relating to the
information presented as relevant to the learning objectives,
as well as to take a critical approach to the information and to
support your answer with references”.
*Please note: as in the assignments, it is important that you
acknowledge any items you use in the discussions which are taken
from the work of others. If you copy and paste from another source,
you must acknowledge the source and reference it*.
*It is always better to use your own words anyway!*

I have had a look at your discussion contributions, and here are my
comments on whether you meet the following Criteria...

DISCUSSION_CRITERIA_HERE

There are some helpful resources on how to carry out referencing in
the Student Handbook and also in the Student Corner - such as the
tutorial from Monash University:
http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/tutorials/citing/index.html
We usually recommend using the Harvard system of referencing, and 
here is the link to a tutorial on this from Nottingham University -
Referencing your work with Harvard:
http://equella.nottingham.ac.uk/uon/items/9ba73656-1729-2453-d9eb-6fd932a12753/1/ViewIMS.jsp
(Note you might have to refresh that page to get it to display properly)
However, the Vancouver style is also frequently used in the medical
scientific literature. There is information on critical thinking in
the Student Corner "How can I develop my Critical Thinking skills?":
http://courses.peoples-uni.org/mod/page/view.php?id=6919&inpopup=1

We will be sending information on the number of posts you have made 
to the discussions in comparison with others on your module at a
later stage.

The discussion forums do remain open, even after the end of the time
period for each Topic, so you can post something to them late if you
have been away.

Please note that contributions to the Student Corner do not count
for credit – the Student Corner is for discussions amongst the
students on common problems and interests (there have been some 
very interesting issues discussed so far so please keep this up if you 
find it useful, but do not forget to keep to the spirit of the
Peoples-uni in the need for evidence rather than just opinion!).

Best wishes.

    Education Coordinator.
