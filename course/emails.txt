Send it by registered mail to:

The amount should be 30 pounds for one module or 60 pounds for two modules.

see that cash is being sent!). The equivalent amount if you can only get

to introduce you to Public Health. This is just to look at and read the
resources, you will not be able to or required to take part in the
discussions or assignments of this demonstration module.

We look forward to your participation this semester, and hope that you
enjoy the experience and find it useful.
